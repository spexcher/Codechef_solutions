# Codechef Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **Codechef** repository! This repository contains solutions to various problems from **Codechef**, organized by problem names. Each solution file corresponds to a specific problem and is named accordingly.

## How to Use

This repository does not follow a folder structure based on problem difficulty or topic. Instead, all solutions are stored directly in the root directory, making it easy to locate them by problem name. Each file is named after the corresponding problem, followed by the programming language used.

### Example File Structure

```bash
Codechef_solutions/
│
├── ProblemName1.cpp
